- 👋 Hello there.
- 🤍 I'm usually either reading a book, playing a video game, messing with computers, or drooling over cars.
- 📚 Learning programming, scripting, cybersecurity and GNU/Linux server administration.
- 🤝 Here to help however I can. I'm a fast learner, so feel free to teach me a thing or two!
- 📧 Reach me here, or don't—it's up to you.
